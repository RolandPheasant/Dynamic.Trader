## Dynamic Data Demo

This is a c# sample wpf project to help get started with Dynamic Data.  I have tried to make the code behind each screen as simple as posible so it is easy to follow.

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/axcp2ktriyix9blt/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/RolandPheasant/Dynamic.Trader/branch/master)

Source code for dynamic data is at [Dynamic Data on GitHub](https://github.com/RolandPheasant/DynamicData) and the blog at http://dynamic-data.org/

The demo illustrates how the following code:

```csharp
var loader = tradeService.All
    .Connect(trade => trade.Status == TradeStatus.Live) //prefilter live trades only
    .Filter(_filter) // apply user filter
    .Transform(trade => new TradeProxy(trade),new ParallelisationOptions(ParallelType.Ordered,5))
    .Sort(SortExpressionComparer<TradeProxy>.Descending(t => t.Timestamp),SortOptimisations.ComparesImmutableValuesOnly)
    .ObserveOnDispatcher()
    .Bind(_data)   // update observable collection bindings
    .DisposeMany() //since TradeProxy is disposable dispose when no longer required
    .Subscribe();
``` 
 produces this

or how the following extract

 ```csharp  
 var loader = tradeService.Live.Connect()
            .Group(trade => trade.CurrencyPair)
            .Transform(group => new CurrencyPairPosition(group))
            .Sort(SortExpressionComparer<CurrencyPairPosition>.Ascending(t => t.CurrencyPair))
            .ObserveOn(schedulerProvider.MainThread)
            .Bind(_data)
            .DisposeMany()
            .Subscribe();

	//when CurrencyPairPosition class does this
	tradesByCurrencyPair.Cache.Connect()
			.QueryWhenChanged(query =>
			{
				var buy = query.Items.Where(trade => trade.BuyOrSell == BuyOrSell.Buy).Sum(trade=>trade.Amount);
				var sell = query.Items.Where(trade => trade.BuyOrSell == BuyOrSell.Sell).Sum(trade => trade.Amount);
				var count = query.Count;
				return new TradesPosition(buy,sell,count);
			})
			.Subscribe(position => Position = position);
        }
```
Produces this.

This is so easy, a few lines of code which after a short learning curve becomes very easy.

Plus many more dynamic data examples. Additionally there are some examples which show how to integrate with [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI). 

The menu looks like this and as you can see there are links to the code behind which hopefully will get you up to speed in no time at all

The examples are being regularly maintained so download again to see more examples.

## Run the demo

- Press 'Download Zip', unpack and open
